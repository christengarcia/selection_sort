# selection_sort

This C# Program Performs a Selection Sort. Here Selection sort is an algorithm of sorting an array where it loops from the start of the loop, and checks through other elements to find the minimum value. After the end of the first iteration, the minimum value is swapped with the current element. The iteration then continues from the 2nd element and so on.
